To get backend installed you have to have a docker installed on your machine.

Installing Docker / Docker compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy file .env.example and rename it to .env
3. Ask Matt to send you credentials from SPORTSRADAR
4. Change variables called SPORTSRADAR_KEY and META_KEY in file .env to values you have got from Matt
5. Run 'docker-compose up'

After this you will have the backend installed on localhost:5000
